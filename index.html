<div class="sidebar">
	<em>Hi</em>
</div>
<div>
	I'm a developer, and I want to help <em>OpenStreetMap</em> 
	
	<p>
		Intro
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<img src="saman.jpg" style="width: 100%">
	<p>
		This is a follow up to a talk given at SotM US in June by Saman.
		Like me he works at MapBox and we've both worked on the website
		and on iD.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Ground up</em> redesign
	<p>
		What Saman proposed in his talk was a ground up redesign of OSM.org.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	No <em>constraints</em>
	<p>
		What would OSM.org look like if we started from scratch, and designed
		without constraints -- without worring about how many servers we have,
		or how many people to run them, or who would implement the vision. And
		also without any constraints around what already exists, with the fact
		that people are invested in the way things currently work, and changing
		a feature they depend on can have a real impact.
		
		With this freedom from constraint, Saman outlined three areas
		of improvement:
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#1: information architecture
	
	<p>
		How do we organize and label the features and functionality
		that OSM.org provides.
		
		The website has grown organically over the years, and we would
		do well to step back and think at a high level about why users
		come to the website, why they come back, and what they want to 
		accomplish when they do.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#2: onboarding experience
	
	<p>
		We could do a better job of informing new visitors what 
		OpenStreetMap is and why they might want to contribute,
		guiding them through the sign up process,
		welcoming them to the community after they've signed up,
		and holding their hand as they make their first edits.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#3: strengthen the community
	
	<p>
		OpenStreetMap is built by a community, yet the social
		features of the website are in fact fairly weak.
		
		In his talk Saman proposed social features in the style of
		Facebook or Strava, and he used the word 'gamification'
		which for some people is a four letter word. But those are
		far from the only way to use technology to strengthen the
		community -- for example,
		there's been much discussion around groups and commenting
		features as a way of bringing together contributors with
		common interests.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#4: It's not <em>2004</em> anymore
	
	<p>
		Let's give the website a more modern look and feel.
		OpenStreetMap has grown up. It's a serious project, it's alive, it's
		current. It should look like the future of mapping, not a turn-of-the
		century website.
	</p>
</div>

<!-- Recap -->

<div class='sidebar'>
	<em>What now?</em>

	<p>
		The best part of Saman's talk, I think, was that it got people thinking
		about what OSM.org could be if it lived up to its full potential.

		And it got me excited about implement the vision that he had shown.
		But as we started
		to talk about implementation in the sprint days that
		followed the conference, we couldn't just ignore the constraints. 
		We had to think
		about how to get there from where we are now, taking into account the
		time and technical resources we have.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	Incremental, organic change
	
	<p>
		And what we came up with, after talking about it, was that we should
		work on incremental improvents that stood on their own, but built toward
		a larger vision.
		
		In other words -- grow the site as it's always grown: gradually,
		organically, with plenty of feedback from the community --
		but guided by this vision, focusing on particular
		areas of improvement.
		
		And so we started working.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	In the <em>open</em>
</div>

	<p>
		And we work in the open, with the community.
		
		Uh, everyone can read this right? These are some
		of the pull requests we submitted. Yeah, there's 
		been a lot of discussion. Thank you to everyone who
		gave us thoughtful, constructive feedback -- it improved
		the work immensely.
		
		So I want to recap what we have accomplished so
		far -- and I mean we, not just Saman and I, but
		everyone who's given feedback and especially Tom
		Hughes, who maintains the website, and reviews every
		change to make sure nothing blows up -- apart from
		the mailing lists.

<!-- Looking Forward -->

<div class="sidebar">
	<em>What Next?</em>
</div>
<div>
	Continuing Incremental Change
	
	<p>
		We're going to continue to work in the open, with feedback
		from the community, on incremental changes that advance the
		goals that we've set out.
		
		To make that concrete, I'm going to share with you some mock
		ups of specific changes we'll be putting forward as pull requests
		in the months ahead.
		
		What's important to note about these mockups is that they are
		much closer to the existing form and functionality of the website
		than what was proposed before. These are very real and actionable
		proposals.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Help</em> &amp; <em>About</em> pages
	
	<p>
		We'd like to create a consolidated About page that
		both explains the project in an accessible way and details
		the Copyright and License terms.
		
		We'd also like to create a dedicated page for linking to help
		resources like the new welcome page, the wiki, and the 
		Q&amp;A site.
		
		Having these dedicated jumping off pages means we can provide
		a clean, uncluttered design for other pages on the site.

		This is it -- this is our vision, evolved. And unlike what
		Saman presented in June, we think this design is actionable,
		fits within the constraints we have, and is something we can
		realize in one or two iterations.
		
		So, I look forward to discussing it with you here at Birmingham,
		at the hack day on Monday, and online.
