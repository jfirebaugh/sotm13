<div>
	Hi
</div>
<div>
	I'm a developer, and I want to help <em>OpenStreetMap</em> 
</div>
<div>
	<img src="saman.jpg">
	<p>
		This is a follow up to a talk given at SotM US in June by Saman.
		Like me he works at MapBox and we've both worked on the website
		and on iD.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<em>Ground up</em> redesign
	<p>
		What Saman proposed in his talk -- it's online, I recommend watching
		it if you haven't already -- was a ground up redesign of OSM.org.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	No <em>constraints</em>
	<p>
		What would OSM.org look like if we started from scratch, and designed
		without resource constraints -- both server resources and
		engineering resources -- the existing feature set, the familiarity of
		the existing design (because folks sometimes get upset if you remove
		or change a feature they depend on).
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#1: information architecture
	
	<p>
		The website has grown organically over the years, accreting a
		number of useful features, but not a lot of attention has been
		paid to thinking about what the purpose of What are the use cases?
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#2: onboarding experience
	
	<p>
		Connecting communities and helping new users
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	#3: strengthen the community
	
	<p>
		New social features
		Gamification (four letter word)
		Facebook, Strava
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	What now<em>?</em>

	<div>
		This was great. It got people thinking about what OSM.org could be if
		it lived up to its full potential.
	</div>
</div>

<!-- Recap -->
<div>
	Constraints
	
	<p>
		I want to implement this vision. But when we start
		talking about implementation, which we did in the sprint days that
		followed SotM, we can no longer ignore the constraints. We had to think
		about how to get there from where we are now, taking into account the
		time and technical resources we have.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	Incremental, organic change
	
	<p>
		And what we came up with, after talking about it, was that we should
		start by working on small improvents that could stand on their own.
		
		- Organic growth. Design changes must also happen organically.

	Goals
</div>
<div>
	3 areas for improvement<br>
	(IA, onboarding, community)
</div>
<div>
	Connecting communities
	
	<p>
		OSM is an open data project -- we focus on the data first and foremost,
		and leave the mapping (and all the other uses) to third parties, with
		the hope that those third party services, or their users, contribute
		back to OSM.
		
		We try to mandate that throught the license terms -- but in fact
		virtually nothing has ever been contributed back through force of
		license. People give back because it benefits them, and because it's
		easy to and fun to do. And the latter is the goal with the design
		changes we're making -- make it easy and fun for users of other
		communities, who may not even have known that they were using OSM
		data, to become contributors.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	It's not <em>1996</em>
	
	<p>
		Serious project
		Alive and current
	</p>
</div>

<!-- Sidebar: constructive criticism -->
<div class="sidebar">
	<em>Change</em>
	
	<p>
		The theme of this State of the Map is Change, and since what we're
		talking about here is change to the website, I wanted to do a little
		sidebar about change itself.
		
		It's interesting to read about
		how people think about and respond to change, and apply that psychology
		to software development.
		
		I can't go into detail, but if this sounds interesting to you too,
		read about: "loss aversion" -- which is a tendency to strongly prefer
		avoiding losses to acquiring gains. And "status quo bias", a preference
		for the current state of affairs.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
	Loss Aversion
</div class="sidebar">
<div class="sidebar">
	Status Quo Bias
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
	<img src="oatmeal1.png" height="100%">
	
	<p>
		We get feedback. The majority of it is positive, helpful, constructive,
		and thoughtful, and has improved what we've done immensely. Thank you
		to everyone who has contributed in this way -- many of you are here
		this weekend. It feels great to get this kind of feedback.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebar">
	<img src="oatmeal2.png" height="100%">
	
	<p>
		But -- not everyone will like every change, and some people seemingly
		dislike like most every change, and are not afraid to express their
		dislike, unconstructively.
				
		I think this is largely a phenomenon of mailing lists. I've never gotten
		unconstructive criticism from someone I've had beers with or met in 
		person -- these are by and large community members who don't attend
		conferences.
		
		I don't have a solution for this. But, this does have an effect on one's
		self esteem, so I just want to say -- be moderate, and, moderate and
		continue to call out bad behavior on mailing lists.
		
		Thank you!
	</p>

<!-- Looking Forward -->

<div>
	What Next?
</div>
<div>
	Continuing Incremental Change
</div>
<div>
	<em>Help</em> &amp; <em>About</em> pages
</div>
<div>
	OpenID &amp; Social Sign Up
</div>
<div>
	[Screenshot of sign in]
	
	<p>
		The sign in page has buttons for quickly signing in with
		known OpenID providers. These should be on the sign up page
		as well, and the option of using Facebook, Twitter, and
		GitHub should be included as well.
		
		Goes back to making the goal of making the sign up process
		as easy as possible.
